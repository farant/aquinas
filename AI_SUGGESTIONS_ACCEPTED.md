## Accepted Suggestions

### 1. Extract VGA Module
**Description:** The VGA-related code (cursor updates, buffer manipulation) could be extracted into a separate `vga.c` module similar to how we extracted `serial.c`.

**Why beneficial:** 
- Better separation of concerns
- Makes the code more testable
- Reduces kernel.c size
- Easier to swap rendering backends in future

**Implementation approach:**
- Create `vga.c` and move VGA buffer operations
- Define clear interface in `vga.h`
- Keep high-level page rendering in kernel.c

**Status:** ACCEPTED - Working on implementation

### 2. Add Bounds Checking Macro
**Description:** Create a bounds checking macro for buffer operations to prevent overflows.

**Why beneficial:**
- Currently we have manual bounds checks scattered through the code
- A macro would ensure consistent checking
- Would make the code more robust against buffer overflows

**Implementation approach:**
```c
#define SAFE_BUFFER_ACCESS(buf, pos, len) ((pos) >= 0 && (pos) < (len))
```

**Status:** ACCEPTED - Working on implementation
